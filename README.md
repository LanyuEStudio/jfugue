JFugue: Java API for Music Programming
============

![Logo](website/static/jfugue_logo.png)

JFugue encourages people of all ages to experiment with the expressive power of music.
Generate musical data interactively or algorithmically, use musical patterns, rhythms,
elements of music theory, including chords and chord progressions, communicate to external
MIDI devices, such as musical keyboards, mixers and more. 


__Create music with only a few lines of code!__
```java
import org.jfugue.player.Player;

public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Player player = new Player();
    player.play("C D E F G A B");
  }
}
```
